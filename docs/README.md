# Redis Connector

The Redis [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to access the Redis commands through the ESB Profile of WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI). Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

## Getting started
To get started, go to [Configuring Redis Operations](configuringRedisOperations.md). Once you have completed your configurations, you can perform various operations with the connector.

## Additional information
For general information on using connectors and their operations in your ESB configurations, see [Using a Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Using+a+Connector). To download the connector, go to  [https://store.wso2.com/store/assets/esbconnector/redis](), and click **Download Connector**. Then you can [add and enable the connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Working+with+Connectors+via+the+Management+Console) in the ESB Profile of WSO2 EI.
